### Analysis of the problem (What are you actually trying to solve) (5%)
There is a lack of automation in terms of testing, building and deploying the solution. Factors such as bug-fixes and adding new features to production, should have an automated process to reduce the unnecessary manual workload needed on several teams in the company.

### Explain and Justify the solution (How does the solution work) (10%)
The solution will work around automating the process of building and deploying the solution so it is easier for the developers to get features tested, fixed and implemented without the need of the lead developer being around all the time to get such tasks done. The solution will ensure that every piece of code that goes out of development for testing and bug checks via unit testing. Code analysis will also be ran to ensure that the code adheres to the coding rules using the given language(s). Code testing will conducted as well to make sure that there aren't any issues with the solution once it is deployed. Once all of that is done, an artefact will be created, which will be used as the deployable product to AWS.



# Simple Todo App with MongoDB, Express.js and Node.js
The ToDo app uses the following technologies and javascript libraries:
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* Node.js
* express-handlebars
* method-override
* connect-flash
* express-session
* mongoose
* bcryptjs
* passport
* docker & docker-compose

## What are the features?
You can register with your email address, and you can create ToDo items. You can list ToDos, edit and delete them. 

# How to use
First install the depdencies by running the following from the root directory:

```
npm install --prefix src/
```

To run this application locally you need to have an insatnce of MongoDB running. A docker-compose file has been provided in the root director that will run an insatnce of MongoDB in docker. TO start the MongoDB from the root direction run the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Then to start the application issue the following command from the root directory:
```
npm run start --prefix src/
```

The application can then be accessed through the browser of your choise on the following:

```
localhost:5000
```

## Testing

Basic testing has been included as part of this application. This includes unit testing (Models Only), Integration Testing & E2E Testing.

### Linting:
Basic Linting is performed across the code base. To run linting, execute the following commands from the root directory:

```
npm run test-lint --prefix src/
```

### Unit Testing
Unit Tetsing is performed on the models for each object stored in MongoDB, they will vdaliate the model and ensure that required data is entered. To execute unit testing execute the following commands from the root directory:

```
npm run test-unit --prefix src/
```

### Integration Testing
Integration testing is included to ensure the applicaiton can talk to the MongoDB Backend and create a user, redirect to the correct page, login as a user and register a new task. 

Note: MongoDB needs to be running locally for testing to work (This can be done by spinning up the mongodb docker container).

To perform integration testing execute the following commands from the root directory:

```
npm run test-integration --prefix src/
```

### E2E Tests
E2E Tests are included to ensure that the website operates as it should from the users perspective. E2E Tests are executed in docker containers. To run E2E Tests execute the following commands:

```
chmod +x scripts/e2e-ci.sh
./scripts/e2e-ci.sh
```
